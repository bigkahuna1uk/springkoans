Contributing
------------

There are a number of ways you can get involved in this project:

* Create [JIRA](http://dev.opencredo.com/jira/browse/OCSPRINGKOANS) tickets for bugs and new features and comment and vote on existing ones you might be interested in.
* Github is for social coding: if you want to write code, we encourage contributions through pull requests from [forks of this repository](http://help.github.com/forking/). If you want to contribute code this way, please reference a JIRA ticket as well covering the specific issue you are addressing.
* Watch for upcoming articles and other materials related to the Spring Koans by [subscribing](http://www.opencredo.com/index.php?format=feed&type=rss) to OpenCredo.org

Before we accept a non-trivial patch or pull request we will need you to sign the contributor's agreement. Signing the contributor's agreement does not grant anyone commit rights to the main repository, but it does mean that we can accept your contributions, and you will get an author credit if we do. Active contributors might be asked to join the core team, and given the ability to merge pull requests.
